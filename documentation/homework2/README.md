# Perception - Homework 2: Colour recognition

Implement and evaluate a reliable colour recognition method.

The goal is to train a classifier to recognize at least six colours: red, green, blue, yellow, white, black. Find different objects of these colours or paint or print them (in different shades and tones) on the paper. Then take a number of images of these objects under different conditions (illumination, viewing angles etc.) and split them on the training and test sets. Using the training set train a classifier and evaluate its performance on the test set. Evaluate different classifiers, try using different colour spaces, and report the results.
